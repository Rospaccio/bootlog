![build-status](https://travis-ci.org/Rospaccio/bootlog.svg?branch=master)

Bootlog is a blog application based on Spring Boot.

## Main goals
1. Using Markdown as the language to write articles;
2. Overcoming the issues of the `code` tag in Wordpress;
3. Integrating Google Analytics;
4. Allowing comments through the integration of Disqus;


## License
Bootlog is released under GPL v. 3 because I strongly believe that knowledge must be free.

## Authors

## Legal notice
No developers have been harassed during the development of this software.
