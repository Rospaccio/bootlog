# Bootlog - another attempt to build my own blog

Bootlog is a blog application based on Spring Boot.

## Main goals
1. Use Markdown as the language to write articles;
2. Overcoming the issues of the `code` tag in Wordpress;
3. Integrating Google Analytics;
4. Allow comments through the integration of Disqus;

## License
Bootlog is released under GPL v. 3 because I strongly believe that knowledge must be free.
